    "Just like real GPS, our APS setup will have multiple speaker-satellites emitting signals, and a single microphone receiver. The signal that we receive at the microphone will be a sum of the individual speaker outputs. We will sift through the microphone signal to find audio signals that are unique from each speaker. We will use a tool called **cross-correlation** to perform this sifting. In order to perform cross-correlation, we compare the signal we receive with stored copies of the signal generated by the speakers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**[Cross-correlation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation)** is a measure of similarity between two functions - in our case these 'functions' will be vectorized time domain signals. It is a mathematical operation defined by taking successive inner products as one vector 'slides past the other'. Intuitively this is a measure of the 'overlap' between two signals with respect to time. For discrete signals, the 'overlap' at time $t$ of the received signal and a copy of a particular speaker generated signal is the inner product of the received signal at that time and a shifted version of the stored copy. Both a mathematical definition and an animation are shown below where $x$ and $y$ are real valued functions.\n",

    "From lecture, we have learnt how to use linear cross-correlation to calculate the cross correlation vector for two generic signals. We have not assumed that they are either period or aperiodic - linear cross correlation  works with any two finite length signals of potentially different lengths (we zero-pad the signals to align them). Let $\\vec{x}$ and $\\vec{y}$ be two generic signals. The $m^{th}$ element of the cross-correlation vector $\\vec{\\rho_{xy}}$ is defined below $(m=0,1,...,N-1)$:  \n",

Specifically, $\\vec{y}[n-m]$ is $\\vec{y}[n]$ delayed by $m$ time steps. In the above animation, the red signal is being shifted and the value of the black signal at a particular time is the inner product of the shifted red signal at this time, and the blue signal. Observe that the red signal has been zero-padded on both sides to match the length of the blue signal. The blue signal is also zero-padded such that the correlation vector (black) contains entries for all valid 'overlaps'.\n",

The difference between finite linear cross correlation and infinitely periodic cross correlation is that we assume that <span style='color:red'><b> we treat the signal as repeating infinitely in time instead of zero padding the signals.</b></span> We instead effectively pad the original signal with itself infinitely many times and choose a finite cross-correlation vector length.\n",

The beacon signals will be used to determine the position of a *receiver* - a microphone. Figure 3a shows examples of waveforms generated by a two beacon system. The beacons are synchronized, i.e all beacon signals are transmitted from their respective beacons simultaneously. Figure 3b demonstrates an exemplar scenario wherein the receiver is further away from beacon 2 than beacon 1, consequently receiving the beacon signal from beacon 2 after the beacon signal from beacon 1.\n",

We can cross-correlate this received signal  with stored copies of each unique beacon signal to determine when each beacon signal arrived at the receiver. For a given beacon signal, this will be the time index that corresponds to the maximum cross-correlation with that particular beacon signal. Notice that in Figure 4b, the cross-correlation of the received signal with a stored copy of beacon signal 1 attains its maximum 3 milliseconds before the cross-correlation of the received signal with beacon signal 2 is maximized. We can therefore infer that beacon signal 1 was received before beacon signal 2, and that the distance of the microphone from the first beacon is less than the distance of the microphone from the second beacon.\n",

This is fine for our purposes, and will still allow us for robust identification of beacon signals, as long as the cross correlation between different beacon signals is small, while the cross correlation of a beacon signal with itself (autocorrelation) is large only when the beacon is not shifted. If these conditions hold, we can still identify the beacon signals that a received signal is composed of, since the cross correlation between a beacon signal and the received signal at the correct offset will always be considerably larger than cross correlation values that correspond to the correlation between two different beacon signals, or cross correlation values that correspond to the correlation between a beacon signal and a shifted version of itself.\n",
